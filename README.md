# Chess-AI
The Goal of this project is to learn more about AI and figure out what can be done to optimise algorithms.
This project is not about building the chess game so I used a chess library: https://github.com/bhlangonijr/chesslib
Also will being using UCI protocol in order to connect it to a gui.
